## Deploy the app

In this section we'll see how to deploy your PhoneGap app to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

But before that let's add custom icons and splashscreens.

You need to provide the **icon** and **splashscreen** in different sizes.

The easiest way to do it is to look at the size of the default **PhoneGap** application.

For the ```ios``` platform they are located at:

```
platforms/ios/CFGMessenger/Resources/icons
platforms/ios/CFGMessenger/Resources/splash
```

and for ```android```, icons and splashcreens are stored together in:

```
platforms/android/res
```

**Challenge**: Replace all 3 folders with the CFGMessenger icons and splashscreens save here [CFG branding](http://google.com)
