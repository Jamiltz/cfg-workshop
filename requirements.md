## Prepare for CFG workshop

We have a lot to cover in one day. So it would be great if you get the head start to get your environment setup.

### What this workshop is about?

We assume that you know enough about ```html```, ```css``` and ```javascript``` to build a basic website.

### Hardware

Apple makes it relativaly difficult for **PC** users to develop **iOS** app. That's why cross-platform development is easier on a **Mac** than a **PC**.
We highly recommend you to bring **Mac** to follow along the day. That's mainly because we may not be able to help you if you have a **PC**.

If you wonder why, here's why: [Mac vs PC Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkRaqB7OXZI)

### Development Environment

The Chrome devtools has great new features to emulate devices such as iPhones, iPads and Android devices.

## Running on iOS

If you have an iPhone you'll need to download **Xcode** fro  the app store. You should download Xcode anyway to run apps on the emulators.

## Running on Android

For Android users we have great news. Chrome has a built-in support for running Android apps without having to install the SDK.

Alternativaly you can test the app on emulators. Create a new account over at [Genymotion](http://www.genymotion.com/) and download the emulator. It's much faster than the ones that ship with the Android SDK.
